Allowing for tracking of expenses

Many standard finanicial institutions have applications to help track the charges that a person puts on their account. Unfortunately, I have found them to be rather stiff in what they allow to be tracked.
Most charges are self-classified and costs can only be viewed within certain periods of time they deem as the right ranges. Therefore, I decided to create a more self-controlled way of seeing and inputting charges to better manage one's expenses.
